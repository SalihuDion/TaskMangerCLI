# TaskMangerCLI

The Task Manager CLI App is a Python-based command-line tool that allows users to manage their daily
tasks directly from the terminal. 
Users can add tasks with descriptions, due dates, and optional priorities, as well as list, complete,
delete, and filter tasks.
Task data is stored locally in a JSON file, ensuring that information is preserved between sessions.
This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of Python fundamentals, file handling,
command-line interfaces, and clean code practices.
